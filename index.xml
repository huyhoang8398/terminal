      <description>Motivation I have used beamer quite a lot to prepare slides for both research and class presentations. I have started to use LaTeX to content in beamer presentation for two years. Sometimes I was concerned about the high ratio of markup to content in beamer presentations. I used to type thousands lines of code just to create a presentation slide which was tiring and time consuming. Thus, I did some research and found a combination of pandoc, markdown, and LaTeX to simplify my process.</description>

      <description>Hi  &amp;ldquo;Hello, friend?&amp;rdquo; That&#39;s lame.
Maybe I should give you a name&amp;hellip;
But that&#39;s a slippery slope.
You&#39;re only in my head.
We have to remember that&amp;hellip;
Shit.
It&#39;s actually happened.
I&#39;m talking to an imaginary person.
